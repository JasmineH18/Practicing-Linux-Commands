Go back to Wazuh dashboard, in my Windows Integrity Monitoring. Clicked the 'Inventory' tab and clicked 'Windows Registry'. Searched for the registry key I created. Searched for 'VillainThanos'. Wazuh will check the registry key and monitor it.

Go to 'Events' tab and it'll check for changes every 30 seconds. Went back to the 'VillainThanos' registry key and edit the default string data to 'Where's the Avengers?'.
