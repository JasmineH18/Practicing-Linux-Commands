From Wazuh, "The Wazuh File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) module monitors and alerts on changes to critical files and directories. This module helps organizations meet compliance requirements and quickly detect file changes that indicate a compromise or cyber attack."

Security Breach Detection:
"Detect security breaches and system tampering using Wazuh FIM. Wazuh monitors files and directories, tracking attributes, permissions, ownership, and content. It uses hash values to detect filesystem changes, identifies malicious activities, and reduces insider threats from individuals or vendors."
