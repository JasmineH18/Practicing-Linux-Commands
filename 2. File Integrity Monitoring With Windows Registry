From Wazuh, "The Wazuh File Integrity Monitoring (FIM) module monitors and alerts on changes to critical files and directories. This module helps organizations meet compliance requirements and quickly detect file changes that indicate a compromise or cyber attack."

Real-time Monitoring:

Security Breach Detection:
"Detect security breaches and system tampering using Wazuh FIM. Wazuh monitors files and directories, tracking attributes, permissions, ownership, and content. It uses hash values to detect filesystem changes, identifies malicious activities, and reduces insider threats from individuals or vendors."

Wazuh helps you monitor modifications to important files and directories to comply with regulations such as PCI DSS, HIPAA, NIST 800-53, TSC, and GDPR.

Centralized Management:

It offers comprehensive reporting on file changes, providing in-depth details of the reported modifications."

Go to 'Events' tab and it'll check for changes every 30 seconds. Went back to the 'VillainThanos' registry key and edit the default string data to 'Where's the Avengers?'.
