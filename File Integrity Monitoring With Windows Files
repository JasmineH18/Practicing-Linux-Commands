Windows
I'll start with Windows 10 virtual machine in VirtualBox. With files I'm going to setup a real notification and rule set. For this to happen, I would go into the Windows host and change some configurations. After completing the below steps, Wazuh Windows Intergrity Monitoring Events section will show a file was changed.

Note: Must have full permission to access the 'ossec-agent' folder. Right click the folder > Properties > Go to 'Security' tab > Click 'Edit' > Select your username in the 'Group or user names:' section > In the 'Permissions for username' section select 'Full Control' > Click 'Apply' > Click 'OK'
