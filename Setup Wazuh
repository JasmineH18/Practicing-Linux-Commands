Before I install Wazuh, I will create my basic lab diagram. The tips I used to create the basic lab is from Mydfir video. Created the diagram using draw.io website. If something needs changing, I will update the diagram.

For this project, I will use the guidance of Networkchuck to setup Wazuh. I will use Linode as my cloud hosting provider. Wazuh would be the server and using Wazuh Docker container. I will be using two agents. Ubuntu and Windows 10 virtual Machine from Virtualbox.  

First, I will get started with Linode, and will access it in my Ubuntu virtual machine. Networkchuck and Linode teamed up to provide Linode free for 60 days with $100 credit. Used the link Networkchuck provided and chose one of the options to sign up, and verify email. 

Second step is to setup the Wazuh Docker. Made sure I'm on the Linode tab on the left. Clicked 'Create' and clicked 'Linode'. Filled out the information and click 'Create Linode'. At the top left, it will provision the Wazauh docker. It will show a green circle with the word 'Running' to let me know it'd done. Looked for SSH Access and copy the information. 

Time to connect to the Wazuh docker. Opened a terminal, paste the SSH access, and hit Enter. Typed 'yes' to accept all fingerprints and type the root password I created. Updated my repositories by typing 'sudo apt update'. After the update, typed 'sudo apt install docker.io docker-compose -y' to install docker.     

I will be following the instructions from the Wazuh docker deployment documentation. This will be complete in the termainal.

Step 1: Clone the Wazuh repository to your system: git clone https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh-docker.git -b v4.7.2
Typed 'ls' to make sure the directory is there. Directory named 'wazuh-docker'. Typed 'cd wazuh-docker', typed 'ls' again, and then typed 'cd single-node'. The path would look like this: root@localhost:~/wazuh-docker/single-node#

Step 2: Get the desired certificates: docker-compose -f generate-indexer-certs.yml run --rm generator
Copy and paste in the terminal. root@localhost:~/wazuh-docker/single-node# docker-compose -f generate-indexer-certs.yml run --rm generator

Step 3: In the terminal, typed 'docker-compose up -d'. root@localhost:~/wazuh-docker/single-node# docker-compose up -d. Typed 'docker stats' to confirm deployment.

To login, go back to your Linode daashboard and go to the 'Network' tab. Copied the 'Reverse DNS'. Opened a new browser tab. Typed https:// and paste the 'Reverse DNS', and hit Enter. The 'Your connection is not private' is ok to see. Clicked 'Advance' and clicked 'Proceed'. It'll show 'Wazuh The Open Source Security Platform'. Input the username/password from Wazuh docker deployment documentation. The setup would be complete once all the checkmarks are done and the page loads.    


Setup agents in Wazuh
Step 1: After siging into your Wazuh account, click 'Add agent'
Step 2: Click 'Deploy new agent'
Step 3: Select your operating system. I added Windows and Linux. Your Wazuh server address is your Linode Reverse DNS, except for the https://. Ex: xx-xx-xxx-xxx.ip.linodeusercontent.com. Add an 'Agent name'. 
Step 4: Copied the command to install the agent, which I did Linux first. Opened a terminal in my Ubuntu virtual machine and paste the command. Hit Enter
Step 5: Copy/paste the command to start the agent in the Ubuntu terminal
Step 6: Back to the Wazuh dashboard, clicked the drop down arrow at the top, and clicked 'Agents'

In the 'Agents' area, my Ubuntu appears. Along with my Windows agent.
