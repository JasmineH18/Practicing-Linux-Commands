This will be a guided project. Guided projects are hands on training. You follow what the teacher is doing on your software, hardware, etc. This will improve your skills on a certain subject. Below are the resources and environments I'm using.

Before I install Wazuh, I will create my basic lab diagram. The tips I used to create the basic lab is from Mydfir video. Created the diagram using draw.io website. If something needs changing, I will update the diagram.

For this project, I will use the guidance of Networkchuck to setup Wazuh. I will use Linode as my cloud hosting provider. Wazuh would be the server and using Wazuh Docker container in Ubuntu. I will be using two agents. Ubuntu and Windows 10 virtual Machine from Virtualbox.  

First, I will get started with Linode, and will access it in my Ubuntu virtual machine. Networkchuck and Linode teamed up to provide Linode free for 60 days with $100 credit. Used the link Networkchuck provided and chose one of the options to sign up, and verify email. 

Second step is to setup the Wazuh Docker. Made sure I'm on the Linode tab on the left. Clicked 'Create' and clicked 'Linode'. Filled out the information.
