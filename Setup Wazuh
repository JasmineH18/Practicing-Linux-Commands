This will be a guided project. Guided projects are hands on training. You follow what the teacher is doing on your software, hardware, etc. This will improve your skills on a certain subject. Below are the resources and environments I'm using.

Before I install Wazuh, I will create my basic lab diagram. The tips I used to create the basic lab is from Mydfir video. Created the diagram using draw.io website. If something needs changing, I will update the diagram.
