Wazuh's threat detection and response capabilities are at the forefront of proactive cybersecurity measures. By continuously monitoring network traffic, system logs, and endpoint activities, Wazuh can swiftly identify suspicious behavior and potential security threats. The platform leverages advanced correlation rules and threat intelligence to detect known malware, intrusions, and anomalous activities. In the event of a confirmed threat, Wazuh enables security teams to respond promptly, contain the incident, and mitigate any potential damage. This integrated approach to threat detection and response enhances an organization's ability to defend against evolving cybersecurity threats effectively.

In Wazuh, there is two main features in threat detection and response. Vulnerabilities and MITRE ATT&CK

The Wazuh vulnerabilities feature is a component of the Wazuh platform that helps users identify and address security vulnerabilities within their systems. This feature leverages vulnerability databases and scanning tools to detect known vulnerabilities in software, operating systems, and other components of the IT infrastructure. By using the vulnerabilities feature in Wazuh, users can proactively identify and remediate security weaknesses before they can be exploited by attackers. It is an essential tool for maintaining the security of your environment and protecting against potential threats. By default it's not enabled. 

MITRE ATT&CK is a globally recognized framework that stands for Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge. It provides a comprehensive knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations. The framework categorizes different stages of a cyber attack, detailing the tactics adversaries use and the techniques they employ within each stage. By aligning security operations with the MITRE ATT&CK framework, organizations can better understand and defend against sophisticated threats. It serves as a valuable resource for improving threat detection, enhancing incident response capabilities, and strengthening overall cybersecurity posture.
